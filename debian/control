Description: FUSE-based client for the Ceph distributed file system
 Ceph is a distributed network file system designed to provide
 excellent performance, reliability, and scalability.  This is a
 FUSE-based client that allows you to mount a Ceph file system without
 root privileges.
 .
 Because the FUSE-based client has certain inherent performance
 limitations, it is recommended that the native Linux kernel client
 be used if possible (see ceph-kclient-source).  If it is not
 practical to load a kernel module (insufficient privileges, older
 kernel, etc.), then the FUSE client will do.

Description: source for client kernel module for the Ceph distributed file system
 Ceph is a distributed network file system designed to provide
 excellent performance, reliability, and scalability.  This is the
 Ceph client source package for building the client kernel module.
 .
 This native kernel client is faster and is more robust than the 
 FUSE-based client (ceph-fuse).  However, you need to compile the
 module against your running kernel and will need root privileges
 to load it.
