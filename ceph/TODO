BUGS?
- proper state diagram for sync, presync, etc. on REPLICAS, and relationshipo to client access?


ISSUES

- group inode, dir expires in trim().

- discover
 - soft: authority selectively repicates, or sets a 'forward' flag in reply
 - hard: authority always replicates (eg. discover for export)
 - forward flag (see soft)
 - error flag   (if file not found, etc.)
 ?what was i talking about? - make sure waiters are properly triggered, either upon dir_rep update, or (empty!) discover reply



- is lock > freeze a bad plan?  what happens when we need to lock multiple spots
  in the hierarchy.. will that cause deadlock?

- log
  - overall logging strategy.  
    - currently (?): do everything immediately, reply when logged.
  - the log grows indefinitely




FIX
- soft and hard metadata should be fully/more independent?
  - hard lock (owner/mode) is relative to namespace
  - soft sync (mtime/size) is relative to inode (even when dangling)

CLEANUP
- client


DOCUMENT


TEST
- test hash/unhash operation
- hash+export: encode list of replicated dir inodes so they can be discovered before import is procesed.
- test nauthitems (wrt hashing?)


IMPLEMENT
- dir sync
 - stat of a dir should return dir size?
 - readdir of hashed dir

- softasync mode
- rmdir
- mkdir
- rename

- log MDS actions
  - imports/exports
  - hash/unhash

- smarter balancing
  - popularity calculation and management is inconsistent, wrong.
  - does it work?

- instrumentation!
- dump active config in run output somewhere

- anchors and hard links
