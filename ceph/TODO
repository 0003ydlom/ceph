=> grep for FIXME :)


- log MDS actions
  - imports/exports
  - hash/unhash

- possible import/export issue: /usr freezing, /usr/local imports (and completes).. weirdness?

- possible/probable bug: lock supposedly => sync, but an inode lock_start doesn't do a client sync.  so far the way it's used makes this okay, but...


- fix client cache stuff so that it can handle a dynamic file system!



CLEANUP
- make mdcache import/export stuff take CDir instead of CInode
- client

TEST
- test unlink
- test hash/unhash operation
- test nauthitems

IMPLEMENT
- dir sync
 - stat of a dir should return dir size?
 - readdir of hashed dir

- softasync mode
- rmdir
- mkdir
- rename

- smarter balancing
  - popularity calculation and management is inconsistent, wrong.
  - does it work?

- instrumentation!
- dump active config in run output somewhere

- anchors and hard links
