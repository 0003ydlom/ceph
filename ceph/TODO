/- export null dentries

- fix readdir to only include stat info for items i'm allowed to

for deadline:
- rush stub
- single thread client bits
- multithread thinger



- string table

/- path lock
 - on export

/- xlock vs. discover?
- xlock vs import/export?

- think about global sync (to be used by shutdown)
  - flush all dirty data to disk
  - flush logs

- hard links

- symlinks

- do real permissions checks



FILE STUFF

- send all file writers to auth
  - migrate open file ppl w/ export
  - simplify replica softlock craziness!

- locks versus import.. big mess!
  - consider active reader+writer on auth at time of export.  how to relax?
  - relaxation in general is tricky..
  - assimilating auth state on importer also tricky.  gather_set weirdness.

- half-assed async for file writers
 - auth needs to know about replicas with writers...
   - opens go to auth
   - auth has set of replica_writers
   - on close, replica tells auth
- replace replica_writers open/close bit will full-blown soft_start/soft_finish hooks?
- need to sync or qsync clients!

- import port soft writer on dir mtime/size...

- recall messages?
- lazy flag?  make a table!
- state diagram for master?  _eval() functions

- EMkdir event
  - properly commit dir, dirty inode+dentry

- put size, mtime in client close op.
- ...and clean up rest of Request/Reply messages!


- think about softlock.mode versus shutdown
- qsync
- lock modes (sync, async)
 - recalls

- freeze interaction.....  test!
  - freeze state diagram?

- add client file handles.
  - fh modes:  RD, RDWR, WR ... append?  :/
  - fh states: SYNC, ASYNC... LOCK? 



=> grep for FIXME :)




ISSUES


- discover
 - soft: authority selectively repicates, or sets a 'forward' flag in reply
 - hard: authority always replicates (eg. discover for export)
 - forward flag (see soft)
 - error flag   (if file not found, etc.)
 - [what was i talking about?] make sure waiters are properly triggered, either upon dir_rep update, or (empty!) discover reply


- log
  - overall logging strategy.  
    - currently (?): do everything immediately, reply when logged.
  - the log grows indefinitely




CLEANUP
- client

- waiters after export... fix will_fail, will_delegate nonsense
 - should a subset of these waiters be triggered immediately after
   export, since discover-based contexts will just be forwarded to the
   new auth?


DOCUMENT
- cache, distributed cache structure and invariants
- export process
- hash/unhash process


TEST
- hashing
 - test hash/unhash operation
 - hash+export: encode list of replicated dir inodes so they can be discovered before import is procesed.
 - test nauthitems (wrt hashing?)


IMPLEMENT

- rename
- truncate

- hash + unhash!

- dir sync
 - stat of a dir should return dir size????
 - readdir of hashed dir

- softasync mode

- log MDS actions
  - imports/exports
  - hash/unhash

- smarter balancing
  - popularity calculation and management is inconsistent/wrong.
  - does it work?

- instrumentation!
- dump active config in run output somewhere

- anchors
- hard links
