pmds = parallel metadata server/system

'test' is a standalone proccess that runs all clients, OSDs, and MDSs in 
a single process with a basic message passer (FakeMessenger).  Useful
for debugging.

'pmds' uses MPI for communication.  A few requirements:
  - Each MDS and OSD gets its own node.  Clients are divided over whatever
    is left over.  So make sure you tell MPI to give you at least 
    num_mds+num_osd+1 processes (num_mds etc defined in config.cc).
