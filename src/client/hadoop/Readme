This directory contains:
CephFSInterface.cc/h: A C++ JNI library used by the Hadoop Java code.
ceph: A directory containing all the Java source files for a 
Hadoop-compliant CephFileSystem.
HADOOP-ceph.patch: A patch for Hadoop. It should apply fine to the trunk 
build but will need some (minor) edits to apply to a .20 version. This 
patch adds in all the files contained in the ceph dir as well as making 
some changes so that Hadoop's configuration code will recognize the 
CephFileSystem properties and classes. It is possible that this will be 
out-of-date compared to the files contained in the ceph dir, so you 
should apply this patch and then copy ceph/* into the appropriate Hadoop 
dir.

There are also a number of javah-generated C header files which are used 
in writing CephFSInterface but can be safely ignored otherwise.

Configuration instructions are included in Javadoc format in the ceph dir.
