A few helper scripts:

mkcephfs.sh -- initialize a new, empty ceph filesystem (by creating a
               fresh monfs)

mkfs.sh     -- same, but also initialize empty object stores.  assumes
               all osds are on the same node, with dev/osd# for storage.

stop.sh     -- stop/kill all daemons.

restart.sh  -- stop everything, then restart everything.  (does not mkfs.)

startnew.sh -- stop everything, initialize new ceph fs, and start it.
               assumes everything is on one node.  for ease of testing.
