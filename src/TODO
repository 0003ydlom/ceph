bugs
- -1 on mds file size recovery

- mon needs to trim history
- meta vs data crush rules
- use libuuid

userspace client
- rm -rf on fragmented directory
- time out caps, wake up waiters on renewal
  - link caps with mds session
- validate dn leases
- clean up ll_ interface, now that we have leases!
- clean up client mds session vs mdsmap behavior?
- client caps migration races
  - caps need a seq number; reap logic needs to be a bit smarter
  - also needs cope with mds failures

kernel client
- close WR|WRBUFFER -> WR transition overwrite hole
  - get_cap_refs needs to block if want WR+WRBUFFER, issued WR, but still implemented WRBUFFER.
- flush caps on sync, fsync, etc.
  - do we need to block?
- timeout mds session close on umount
- deal with CAP_RDCACHE properly: invalidate cache pages?
- procfs/debugfs
  - adjust granular debug levels too
    - should we be using debugfs?
  - a dir for each client instance (client###)?
  - hooks to get mds, osd, monmap epoch #s
- vfs
 - can we use dentry_path(), if it gets merged into mainline?
- io / osd client
  - osd ack vs commit handling.  hmm!

client
- clean up client mds session vs mdsmap behavior?
- client caps migration races
  - caps need a seq number; reap logic needs to be a bit smarter
  - also needs cope with mds failures

osdmon
- monitor needs to monitor some osds...

crush
- more efficient failure when all/too many osds are down
- allow forcefeed for more complicated rule structures.  (e.g. make force_stack a list< set<int> >)
- "knob" bucket

pgmon
- monitor pg states, notify on out?
- watch osd utilization; adjust overload in cluster map

mon
- paxos need to clean up old states.
- some sort of tester for PaxosService...
- osdmon needs to lower-bound old osdmap versions it keeps around?

mds nested
- fix rejoin vs updated dirfrag nested/dirlocks

mds mustfix
- rollback vs accounting is just broken!  can we avoid it.
  - even with _just_ parent dir mtime, the rollback metablob isn't sufficient during replay.. we need special handling regardless.
- when renaming a dir, how do we know if we need to update the anchor table?

- replay of dir fragmentation  (dont want dir frozen, pins, etc.?)
- fix rm -r vs mds exports
- rename slave in-memory rollback on failure
- proper handling of cache expire messages during rejoin phase?
  -> i think cache expires are fine; the rejoin_ack handler just has to behave if rejoining items go missing
- try_remove_unlinked_dn thing

- rerun destro trace against latest, with various journal lengths

mds
- lease length heuristics
  - mds lock last_change stamp?

- fix file_data_version

- fix reconnect/rejoin open file weirdness
- get rid of C*Discover objects for replicate_to .. encode to bufferlists directly?
- consistency points/snapshots
  - dentry versions vs dirfrags...
- failure during reconnect vs clientmap.  

- make truncate faster with a trunc_seq, attached to objects as attributes?

- inode.rctime (recursive mtime)?
- make inode.size reflect directory size (number of entries)?

- osd needs a set_floor_and_read op for safe failover/STOGITH-like semantics.

- could mark dir complete in EMetaBlob by counting how many dentries are dirtied in the current log epoch in CDir...

- fix rmdir empty exported dirfrag race
  - export all frags <= 1 item?  then we ensure freezing before empty, avoiding any last unlink + export vs rmdir race.
  - how to know full dir size (when trimming)?
    - put frag size/mtime in fragmap in inode?  we will need that anyway for stat on dirs
      - will need to make inode discover/import_decode smart about dirfrag auth
    - or, only put frag size/mtime in inode when frag is closed.  otherwise, soft (journaled) state, possibly on another mds.
  - need to move state from replicas to auth.  simplelock doesn't currently support that.
    - ScatterLock or something?  hrm.

- FIXME how to journal/store root and stray inode content? 
  - in particular, i care about dirfragtree.. get it on rejoin?
  - and dir sizes, if i add that... also on rejoin?

- efficient stat for single writers
- add FILE_CAP_EXTEND capability bit


journaler
- fix up for large events (e.g. imports)
- use set_floor_and_read for safe takeover from possibly-not-quite-dead otherguy.
- should we pad with zeros to avoid splitting individual entries?
  - make it a g_conf flag?
  - have to fix reader to skip over zeros (either <4 bytes for size, or zeroed sizes)
- need to truncate at detected (valid) write_pos to clear out any other partial trailing writes


fsck
- fsck.ebofs
- online mds fsck?
- object backpointer attrs to hint catastrophic reconstruction?



rados snapshots
- integrate revisions into ObjectCacher?
- clean up oid.rev vs op.rev in osd+osdc

- attr.crev is rev we were created in.
- oid.rev=0 is "live".  defined for attr.crev <= rev.
- otherwise, defined for attr.crev <= rev < oid.rev  (i.e. oid.rev is upper bound, non-inclusive.)

- write|delete is tagged with op.rev
  - if attr.crev < op.rev
    - we clone to oid.rev=rev (clone keeps old crev)
    - change live attr.crev=rev.
  - apply update
- read is tagged with op.rev
  - if 0, we read from 0 (if it exists).
  - otherwise we choose object rev based on op.rev vs oid.rev, and then verifying attr.crev <= op.rev.


objecter
- maybe_request_map should set a timer event to periodically re-request.
- transaction prepare/commit?
- read+floor_lockout

osd/rados
- how does an admin intervene when a pg needs a dead osd to repeer?

- a more general fencing mechanism?  per-object granularity isn't usually a good match.

- consider implications of nvram writeahead logs

- flag missing log entries on crash recovery  --> WRNOOP? or WRLOST?

- efficiently replicate clone() objects
- fix heartbeat wrt new replication
- mark residual pgs obsolete  ???
- rdlocks
- optimize remove wrt recovery pushes
- report crashed pgs?

messenger
- fix messenger shutdown.. we shouldn't delete messenger, since the caller may be referencing it, etc.

simplemessenger
- close idle connections

objectcacher
- merge clean bh's
- ocacher caps transitions vs locks
- test read locks

reliability
- heartbeat vs ping?
- osdmonitor, filter

ebofs
- btrees
  - checksums
  - dups
  - sets

- optionally scrub deallocated extents
- clone()

- map ObjectStore

- verify proper behavior of conflicting/overlapping reads of clones
- combine inodes and/or cnodes into same blocks
- fix bug in node rotation on insert (and reenable)
- fix NEAR_LAST_FWD (?)

- awareness of underlying software/hardware raid in allocator so that we
  write full stripes _only_.
  - hmm, that's basically just a large block size.

- rewrite the btree code!
  - multithreaded
  - eliminate nodepools
  - allow btree sets
  - allow arbitrary embedded data?
  - allow arbitrary btrees
  - allow root node(s?) to be embedded in onode, or whereever.
  - keys and values can be uniform (fixed-size) or non-uniform.  
    - fixed size (if any) is a value in the btree struct.  
      - negative indicates bytes of length value?  (1 -> 255bytes, 2 -> 65535 bytes, etc.?)
    - non-uniform records preceeded by length.  
    - keys sorted via a comparator defined in btree root.  
      - lexicographically, by default.

- goal
  - object btree key->value payload, not just a data blob payload.
  - better threading behavior.
    - with transactional goodness!

- onode
  - object attributes.. as a btree?
  - blob stream
  - map stream.
    - allow blob values.
