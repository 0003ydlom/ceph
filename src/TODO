snaps on kclient

- short reads not allowed..
- short writes ...?

- need to do ORDERSNAP flag
- to get sync write retry and delayed flushsnap for sync writes

- vfs writepage should noop if page isn't writeable (i.e. not oldest snap)
- make the begin_write wait on writeback respect ordering.. i.e., wait for all older snap pages to write

snaps on uclient
- delay FLUSHSNAP until after (buffered) flush
- do pickysnap(?) flag thing

snaps on mds
- file size recovery needs to probe possibly a _range_ snaps.

- mds server ops
  - link rollback
  - rename rollback

- hard link backpointers
  - anchor source dir
  - build snaprealm for any hardlinked file
  - include snaps for all (primary+remote) parents

snaps on osd
- garbage collection
- efficient recovery of clones using the clone diff info

userspace client
- fix wait_on_list.. Cond* needs to be stable if a signal wakes us up
- handle session STALE
- time out caps, wake up waiters on renewal
  - link caps with mds session
- validate dn leases
- fix lease validation to check session ttl
- clean up ll_ interface, now that we have leases!
- clean up client mds session vs mdsmap behavior?
- stop using mds's inode_t?
- fix readdir vs fragment race by keeping a separate frag pos, and ignoring dentries below it

kernel client
- snap ordered writeout?
- make writepages maybe skip pages with errors?
  - EIO, or ENOSPC?
  - ... writeback vs ENOSPC vs flush vs close()... hrm...
- set mapping bits for ENOSPC, EIO?
- flush caps on sync, fsync, etc.
  - do we need to block?
- timeout mds session close on umount
- deal with CAP_RDCACHE properly: invalidate cache pages?
- procfs/debugfs
  - adjust granular debug levels too
    - should we be using debugfs?
  - a dir for each client instance (client###)?
  - hooks to get mds, osd, monmap epoch #s
- io / osd client
  - osd ack vs commit handling.  hmm!
- fix readdir vs fragment race by keeping a separate frag pos, and ignoring dentries below it

vfs issues
- real_lookup() race:
  1- hash lookup find no dentry
  2- real_lookup() takes dir i_mutex, but then finds a dentry
  3- drops mutex, then calld d_revalidate.  if that fails, we return ENOENT (instead of looping?)
- vfs_rename_dir()

client
- clean up client mds session vs mdsmap behavior?

osdmon
- monitor needs to monitor some osds...

crush
- more efficient failure when all/too many osds are down
- allow forcefeed for more complicated rule structures.  (e.g. make force_stack a list< set<int> >)
- "knob" bucket

pgmon
- include osd vector with pg state
  - check for orphan pgs
- monitor pg states, notify on out?
- watch osd utilization; adjust overload in cluster map

mon
- paxos need to clean up old states.
- some sort of tester for PaxosService...
- osdmon needs to lower-bound old osdmap versions it keeps around?

mds
- whats with the 'clear if dirtyscattered' bit in decode_import_inode()?

- proper handling of cache expire messages during rejoin phase?
  -> i think cache expires are fine; the rejoin_ack handler just has to behave if rejoining items go missing
- try_remove_unlinked_dn thing

- rename: importing inode... also journal imported client map?

- rerun destro trace against latest, with various journal lengths

- lease length heuristics
  - mds lock last_change stamp?

- handle slow client reconnect (i.e. after mds has gone active)

- fix reconnect/rejoin open file weirdness

- can we get rid of the dirlock remote auth_pin weirdness on subtree roots?
- anchor_destroy needs to xlock linklock.. which means it needs a Mutation wrapper?
  - ... when it gets a caller.. someday..

- make truncate faster with a trunc_seq, attached to objects as attributes?

- osd needs a set_floor_and_read op for safe failover/STOGITH-like semantics.

- could mark dir complete in EMetaBlob by counting how many dentries are dirtied in the current log epoch in CDir...

- FIXME how to journal/store root and stray inode content? 
  - in particular, i care about dirfragtree.. get it on rejoin?
  - and dir sizes, if i add that... also on rejoin?

- efficient stat for single writers
- add FILE_CAP_EXTEND capability bit


journaler
- fix up for large events (e.g. imports)
- use set_floor_and_read for safe takeover from possibly-not-quite-dead otherguy.
- should we pad with zeros to avoid splitting individual entries?
  - make it a g_conf flag?
  - have to fix reader to skip over zeros (either <4 bytes for size, or zeroed sizes)
- need to truncate at detected (valid) write_pos to clear out any other partial trailing writes


fsck
- fsck.ebofs
- online mds fsck?
- object backpointer attrs to hint catastrophic reconstruction?

objecter
- fix failure handler...
  - generic mon client?
- maybe_request_map should set a timer event to periodically re-request.
- transaction prepare/commit?
- read+floor_lockout

osd/rados
- how does an admin intervene when a pg needs a dead osd to repeer?

- a more general fencing mechanism?  per-object granularity isn't usually a good match.

- consider implications of nvram writeahead logs

- flag missing log entries on crash recovery  --> WRNOOP? or WRLOST?

- efficiently replicate clone() objects
- fix heartbeat wrt new replication
- mark residual pgs obsolete  ???
- rdlocks
- optimize remove wrt recovery pushes
- report crashed pgs?

messenger
- fix messenger shutdown.. we shouldn't delete messenger, since the caller may be referencing it, etc.

simplemessenger
- close idle connections

objectcacher
- merge clean bh's
- ocacher caps transitions vs locks
- test read locks

reliability
- heartbeat vs ping?
- osdmonitor, filter

ebofs
- btrees
  - checksums
  - dups
  - sets

- optionally scrub deallocated extents
- clone()

- map ObjectStore

- verify proper behavior of conflicting/overlapping reads of clones
- combine inodes and/or cnodes into same blocks
- fix bug in node rotation on insert (and reenable)
- fix NEAR_LAST_FWD (?)

- awareness of underlying software/hardware raid in allocator so that we
  write full stripes _only_.
  - hmm, that's basically just a large block size.

- rewrite the btree code!
  - multithreaded
  - eliminate nodepools
  - allow btree sets
  - allow arbitrary embedded data?
  - allow arbitrary btrees
  - allow root node(s?) to be embedded in onode, or whereever.
  - keys and values can be uniform (fixed-size) or non-uniform.  
    - fixed size (if any) is a value in the btree struct.  
      - negative indicates bytes of length value?  (1 -> 255bytes, 2 -> 65535 bytes, etc.?)
    - non-uniform records preceeded by length.  
    - keys sorted via a comparator defined in btree root.  
      - lexicographically, by default.

- goal
  - object btree key->value payload, not just a data blob payload.
  - better threading behavior.
    - with transactional goodness!

- onode
  - object attributes.. as a btree?
  - blob stream
  - map stream.
    - allow blob values.

remaining hard problems
- how to cope with file size changes and read/write sharing


snapshot notes --


osd
- pass snap lineage with osd op/capability
- tag each non-live object with the set of snaps it is defined over
  - osdmap has sparse map of extant snapids.  incrementals are simple rmsnapid, and max_snapid increase
  - put each object in first_snap, last_snap collections.
  - use background thread to trim old snaps.
  - for each object in first_snap|last_snap collections,
    - get snap list,
    - filter against extant snaps
    - adjust collections, or delete

- adjust coll_t namespace to allow first_snap/last_snap collections..
  - pg.u.type = CEPH_PG_TYPE_SNAP_LB/UB?

- read: 
   oid.snap=NOSNAP op.snaps=[3,2,1]  // read latest
   oid.snap=3      op.snaps=[3,2,1]  // read old snap 3
- write:
  - oid.snap=NOSNAP op.snaps=[3,2,1]  // write to latest
      clone NOSNAP to oid.snaps[0] if oid:snaps[0] != snaps[0]
        set snap_first based on snaps array.
    - write(oid.snap=NOSNAP snaps=[3,2,1])  oid.snap=NOSNAP oid:prior=3,2,1
        -> do nothing, write to existing
    - write(oid.snap=NOSNAP snaps=[300,2,1])  oid.snap=NOSNAP oid:prior=2,1
        -> clone to oid.snap=300, snaps=300
    - write(oid.snap=NOSNAP snaps=[2,1])  oid.snap=NOSNAP oid:prior=3,2,1
        -> slow request, but who cares.  use snaps=3,2,1, write to existing as above.
    - write(oid.snap=NOSNAP snaps=[3,2,1])  oid.snap=NOSNAP oid:prior=1
        -> clone to oid.snap=3, snaps=3,2

screw "snap writeback":
 - if client is buffering, it has exclusive access to the object.  therefore, it can flush older
   snaps before newer ones.  done.
   -> yeah... but it's difficult to implement in the kclient...
 - if multiple clients are writing synchronously, then the client doesn't care if the osd pushes a write "forward" in time to the next snapshot, since it hasn't completed yet.
   -> actually, it does, since the client is reporting a size+mtime back to the mds with the cap flush snap
    > set a PICKYSNAP flag, that makes the osd return something like -EAGAIN, that is passed bck by osdc
    > delay FLUSHSNAP.  in ceph_write
     > block before submitting new writes
     > wait before resubmitting retry ios
     > send FLUSHSNAP once nothing in flight
    > 


issues:
- how to log and replication all this cloning...
  - snap trimming is async from replicated writes
- snap trimming in general needs to be fast.. and probably a background process..
  -> logically put per-pg snap removal as a discrete pg log event?
  - need to index snap_first/last on a per-pg basis... 128-bit collections?  or ditch ebofs?
