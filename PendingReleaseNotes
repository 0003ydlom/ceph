~~~~~

* The 'ceph -s' or 'ceph status' command's 'num_in_osds' field in the
  JSON and XML output has been changed from a string to an int.

* The per-op return code in librados' ObjectWriteOperation interface
  is now filled in again.

* The librados cmpxattr operation now handles xattrs containing null bytes as
  data rather than null-terminated strings.
