v0.67.8
=======

- 'rbd ls' on a pool which never held rbd images now exits with code
  0. It outputs nothing in plain format, or an empty list in
  non-plain format. This is consistent with the behavior for a pool
  which used to hold images, but contains none. Scripts relying on
  this behavior should be updated.

- HEALTH_WARN on 'mon osd down out interval == 0'. Having this option set
  to zero on the leader acts much like having the 'noout' flag set.  This
  warning will only be reported if the monitor getting the 'health' or
  'status' request has this option set to zero.
