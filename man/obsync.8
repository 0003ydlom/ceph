.TH OBSYNC 8
.SH NAME
obsync \- The object synchronizer tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B obsync [ \fIoptions\fP ] \fIsource\fP \fIdestination\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B obsync
Obsync is an object syncrhonizer tool designed to transfer objects between
different object storage systems.  Similar to rsync, you specify a source and a
deestination, and it will transfer objects between them until the destination
has all the objects in the source. Obsync will never modify the source-- only the
destination.

By default, obsync does not delete anything. However, by specifying \fB--delete-after\fP
or \fB--delete-before\fP, you can ask it to delete objects from the destination that are
not in the source.

.SH TARGET TYPES
Obsync supports \fIS3\fP via \fIlibboto\fP.
To use the s3 target, your URL should look like this:
s3://\fIhost-name\fP/\fIbucket-name\fP

Obsync supports storing files locally via the \fIfile://\fP target.
To use the file target, your URL should look like this:
file://\fIdirectory-name\fP

Alternately, give no prefix, like this:
\fI\./directory-name\fP

Obsync supports storing files in a \fIRados Gateway\fP backend via the \fIlibrados\fP Python bindings.
To use the rgw target, your URL should look like this:
rgw:\fIceph-configuration-path\fP:\fIrgw-bucket-name\fP

\fB\-\-no-preserve-acls\fP
Don't preserve ACLs when copying objects.

\fB\-v\fP | \fB\-\-verbose\fP
Be verbose.

\fB\-V\fP | \fB\-\-more-verbose\fP
Be really, really verbose (developer mode)

\fB\-x\fP \fBSRC\fP=\fBDST\fP | \fB\-\-xuser\fP \fBSRC\fP=\fBDST\fP
Set up a user translation. You can specify multiple user translations with
multiple \fB--xuser\fP arguments.

\fB\-\-force\fP

source objects.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
\fBSRC_AKEY\fP          Access key for the source URL

\fBSRC_SKEY\fP          Secret access key for the source URL

\fBDST_AKEY\fP          Access key for the destination URL

\fBDST_SKEY\fP          Secret access key for the destination URL

\fBAKEY\fP              Access key for both source and dest

\fBSKEY\fP              Secret access key for both source and dest

\fBDST_CONSISTENCY\fP   Set to 'eventual' if the destination is eventually consistent.
If the destination is eventually consistent, we may have to retry certain operations
multiple times.

.SH EXAMPLES
\fIAKEY=... SKEY=... obsync -c -d -v ./backup-directory s3://myhost1/mybucket1\fP

Copy objects from backup-directory to mybucket1 on myhost1

\fISRC_AKEY=... SRC_SKEY=...  DST_AKEY=... DST_SKEY=...
obsync -c -d -v s3://myhost1/mybucket1 s3://myhost1/mybucket2\fP

Copy objects from mybucket1 to mybucket2
